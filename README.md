Season-Manager
==============

This project is a django site to organize the process of planning a traning season. Specifically,
I am interested in planning a triathlon season, but the idea is for it to be generic enough that
I could use it for other training as well.

The secondary purpose is as an opportunity for me to learn Python/Django as well as experimenting
with some of the DB backends employed.

This project is currently using Django 1.5 on Python 3.3.
